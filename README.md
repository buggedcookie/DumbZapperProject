# "Zapper" From Webcam Test Project

I don't know what I was doing at all, I was slowly going insane anyway

# How to use
- Launch it, with your webcam connected
- Aim at the white squares and tadaaaa a "zapper" no sounds, nothing, just a test
- Could connect this to some retro emulated games if possible... a free/cheap solution for people who have old webcam
- You just need to adjust all the settings manually and hope to find the right one... (Ain't no way I'm continuing this project... or am I?)
